        <p> Match Day Shuttle flights to Doha<br><br>If you’re a ticketholder to the world’s biggest football show, you can book a return Match Day Shuttle flight from Dubai to Doha with flydubai. A Match Day Shuttle flight allows you to hop on a flight to Doha, watch your match and return back to Dubai the same day.<br><br>
*There is a maximum-stay restriction of 24 hours for all return Match Day Shuttle flights booked from Dubai to Doha.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Apply for a Hayya Card</h3><p>You’ll also need to apply for a Hayya Card. This will allow you to board a flydubai Match Day Shuttle flight as well as provide entry to Qatar (for international ticketholders), entry to the stadiums (with a valid match ticket), access to free public transport from 10 November 2022 to 23 December 2022 and smart journey planning (via the Hayya app).</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Match Day Shuttle flight fares</h3><p>A return Match Day Shuttle flight can be booked for an adult or child in Economy Class starting from USD 258 and in Business Class starting from USD 998 (both fares inclusive of all taxes). These special fares are non-refundable and they do not include a checked baggage allowance, so you’ll need to carry everything you need in your hand baggage. The hand baggage allowance is up to 7 kg in economy and up to 14 kg in business, however, we recommend travelling light. Subject to availability, you can change the time or date of your Match Day Shuttle flight for a charge of USD 50. Please note that the name of a passenger cannot be changed.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Dubai World Central (DWC)</h3><p>All Match Day Shuttle flights will operate from Dubai World Central (DWC) to Doha International Airport (DIA) between Monday 21 November 2022 and Monday 19 December 2022. When you book, please ensure you select a flight that arrives at least four hours before match kick-off.</p>
    <br><p>*Subject to government approvals<br><br>We will continue to operate scheduled services from Dubai International (DXB) to Doha International Airport (DIA) during the tournament. However, please note that you will still need a Hayya Card to enter Qatar from 01 November 2022 until 23 January 2023. This does not apply to Qatari nationals or Qatari residents.<br><br>For more information about Match Day Shuttle flights, please go to Frequently Asked Questions.</p>
